# SafeVision-WebApp 🚦  
**AI + AR Powered Predictive Safety Navigation (Web Prototype)**  

---

## 📌 About the Project  
SafeVision is an innovative web-based prototype designed to enhance **urban safety** using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR).  
The app provides **predictive safety navigation**, helping users avoid unsafe zones while traveling, especially at night or in unfamiliar areas.  

### ✨ Inspiration  
The rise of unsafe incidents in cities inspired me to create a **real-time safety assistant** that uses AI predictions and AR-based alerts.  
I wanted to build something that not only gives navigation but also **ensures safety awareness**.  

### 🛠️ What I Learned  
- How to design and build a **full-stack web app prototype**.  
- Implementing **AI concepts for predictive alerts**.  
- Using **AR-based visual markers** in web applications.  
- Working with **web deployment tools (GitHub Pages)**.  

### ⚡ Challenges Faced  
- Integrating AR effects within browser compatibility.  
- Handling real-time data and making it user-friendly.  
- Deploying a complete web prototype on a free hosting platform.
